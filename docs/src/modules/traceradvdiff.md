# TracerAdvDiff

### Basic Equations

This module solves the advection diffusion equation for a passive tracer
concentration `c` in two-dimensions:

$$c_t + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla c = \kappa \nabla^2 c$$ ,

where $\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ is the two-dimensional advecting velocity and $\kappa$
is the diffusivity.

### Implementation

Coming soon.
