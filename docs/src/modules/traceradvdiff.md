# TracerAdvDiff Module

### Basic Equations

This module solves the advection diffusion equation for a passive tracer
concentration $c(x,y,t)$ in two-dimensions:

$$\partial_t c + \boldsymbol{u} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c = \kappa \nabla^2 c\ ,$$

where $\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ is the two-dimensional advecting velocity and $\kappa$
is the diffusivity.

### Implementation

Coming soon.
