# Contributors Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to FourierFlows.jl! 

Please feel free to ask us questions and chat with us at any time if you're
unsure about anything.

Best way to get in touch is to either just open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl/issues) 
(don't be shy!) or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl/discussions).

We follow the [ColPrac guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) for collaborative
practices. New contributors should make sure to read that guide.

## What can I do?

* Tackle an existing [issue](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl/issues).

* Improve documentation, docstrings, or comments if you found something is hard to use.

* Implement a new feature (e.g., a new diagnostic into a module).

If you're interested in working on something, let us know by commenting on an existing issue 
or by opening a new issue. This is to make sure no one else is working on the same issue and 
so we can help and guide you in case there is anything you need to know beforehand.
